# Evidence Cam Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** February 2026

## Overview

Evidence Cam is a video recording application designed for personal evidence documentation. This policy explains what data the app collects, how it's stored, and your rights as a user.

**Key Point:** All recordings you create are owned entirely by you. The app publisher has no access to your videos, audio, or personal data.

---

## What Data Does the App Collect?

### Data You Create
- **Video recordings** - Captured through your device's camera
- **Audio** - Recorded alongside video
- **GPS coordinates** - Embedded in video overlay (if location permission granted)
- **Timestamps** - Date and time of recordings

### Data Stored Locally
- Recording preferences (quality, segment duration)
- Dropbox connection status (if configured)
- Privacy policy acceptance status

### Data NOT Collected
- Personal identification information
- Usage analytics or telemetry
- Crash reports sent to the publisher
- Any data transmitted to the app publisher's servers

---

## Where Is Your Data Stored?

### On Your Device
All recordings are stored in your device's local storage under the app's private directory. You have full control over these files through the app's Gallery feature.

### Cloud Storage (Optional)
If you choose to enable Dropbox backup:
- Videos are uploaded directly to **your personal Dropbox account**
- The app connects to Dropbox using your own credentials
- Files are stored in the "Apps/EvidenceCamApp" folder in your Dropbox
- The publisher has no access to your Dropbox account or uploaded files

---

## What Can the Publisher See?

| Data Type | Publisher Access |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Your videos and audio | **None** |
| Your GPS location | **None** |
| Your Dropbox files | **None** |
| Your device information | **None** |
| App crash data | **None** |
| Usage statistics | **None** |

**The publisher operates no servers that receive your data.** All functionality runs locally on your device or through your own third-party accounts (Dropbox).

---

## What Can You Control?

### You Have Full Control Over:
- **All recordings** - View, export, share, or delete at any time
- **Location tracking** - Grant or deny GPS permission; recordings work without it
- **Cloud backup** - Entirely optional; disable or disconnect Dropbox anytime
- **Local storage** - Delete recordings individually or clear all data
- **App data** - Uninstalling the app removes all local preferences

### How to Delete Your Data:
1. **Individual recordings:** Use the Gallery to select and delete
2. **All local data:** Uninstall the app or clear app data in Android Settings
3. **Cloud backups:** Delete files directly from your Dropbox account

## Permissions Explained

| Permission | Purpose | Required? |
|------------|---------|-----------|
| Camera | Record video | Yes |
| Microphone | Record audio with video | Yes |
| Location | Add GPS coordinates to video overlay | No |
| Notifications | Show recording status | No |
| Storage/Media | Save and access recordings | Yes |

**Optional permissions:** If you deny location or notification permissions, the app will still function. GPS coordinates simply won't appear on your recordings, and you won't receive status notifications.

---

## Third-Party Services

### Dropbox (Optional)
If you choose to connect Dropbox:
- You authenticate directly with Dropbox using their secure OAuth flow
- The app requests only the permissions needed to upload files to your app folder
- Your Dropbox credentials are never visible to the app publisher
- Dropbox's own privacy policy applies to files stored in your account: https://www.dropbox.com/privacy

---

## Legal Considerations

### Your Responsibility
You are solely responsible for:
- Complying with local laws regarding video and audio recording
- Obtaining consent where required by law
- How you use, store, and share your recordings

### Consent Laws
Many jurisdictions require consent before recording others. The app displays a reminder about this responsibility. Research your local laws before using the app to record.

---

## Data Security

- Recordings are stored in the app's private storage directory
- Dropbox transfers use HTTPS encryption
- No data is transmitted to the publisher's servers
- Your Dropbox authentication tokens are stored securely on-device

---

## Children's Privacy

This app is not intended for use by children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children.

---

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy occasionally. Significant changes will be communicated through app updates. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance.
